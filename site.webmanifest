//The display property in the Web App Manifest determines how your web app is shown when launched. Here are the possible values:

//fullscreen: The app will be displayed in full-screen mode, without any browser UI elements (like the address bar or navigation controls). This makes the app feel like a native mobile app.

//standalone: The app is displayed in its own window, without browser chrome (i.e., no address bar or tabs), but it still has a status bar at the top. This gives a more native app feel, but users can still see that it's a web app (in contrast to fullscreen).

//minimal-ui: Similar to standalone, but with a minimal set of browser UI elements, such as back and forward buttons, and a URL bar. Itâ€™s useful for apps that want to be more web-like but still need some navigation.

//browser: The app behaves like a standard webpage inside the browser with the full set of browser UI elements, including the address bar and tabs.
