//The display property in the Web App Manifest determines how your web app is shown when launched. Here are the possible values:

//fullscreen: The app will be displayed in full-screen mode, without any browser UI elements (like the address bar or navigation controls). This makes the app feel like a native mobile app.

//standalone: The app is displayed in its own window, without browser chrome (i.e., no address bar or tabs), but it still has a status bar at the top. This gives a more native app feel, but users can still see that it's a web app (in contrast to fullscreen).

//minimal-ui: Similar to standalone, but with a minimal set of browser UI elements, such as back and forward buttons, and a URL bar. It’s useful for apps that want to be more web-like but still need some navigation.

//browser: The app behaves like a standard webpage inside the browser with the full set of browser UI elements, including the address bar and tabs.

Cryptographic Verification: Use a digital signature or hash to ensure the NFC data hasn't been tampered with. This is essential for security.
Database Lookup: Compare the NFC data (e.g., a unique shoe ID) against a database of legitimate shoes.
More Detailed Information: Display more information about the shoe (e.g., size, color, authenticity certificate) after verification.
User Feedback:  Provide more informative feedback to the user during the scanning and verification process.  For example:

"Connecting to NFC reader..."
"Processing data..."
"Verification successful! Shoe details:" (followed by the details)
"Verification failed: Invalid NFC tag."
"Verification failed: Shoe not found in database."
UI/UX Enhancements:

Loading Indicator: Show a loading spinner or progress bar while the NFC data is being processed.
Button State: Disable the "Verify" button while a scan is in progress to prevent multiple clicks.
Clearer Instructions: Provide more explicit instructions to the user (e.g., "Hold your phone near the shoe's tag").
Styling: Improve the styling of the output display to make the information easier to read. Consider using a table or list to present shoe details.

Navigate to the site you want to debug.
In the chrome://inspect window on your computer, click inspect under your device and the page you want to debug.
You can now use Chrome's Developer Tools on your computer to inspect, modify, and debug your Android browser's page.

2. Using Chrome’s DevTools on Android (via WebView or DevTools App)
Another option is using a DevTools app or WebView in your Android app to enable debugging.
